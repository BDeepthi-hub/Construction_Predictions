# Construction_Predictions
Construction Business Predictions project leverages data science techniques to predict and analyze key financial and operational metrics in the construction industry. It focuses on building predictive models to estimate actual cost, profit, and project duration, enabling better decision-making for construction project planning and budgeting.

**Objective** 
To develop machine learning models that can:

Predict actual project costs based on initial estimates and project parameters

Estimate profitability and detect cost overruns

Analyze factors affecting project duration and status

Provide actionable business insights through data visualizations

**Technologies Used**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

Seaborn / Matplotlib for visualizations

Jupyter Notebook
